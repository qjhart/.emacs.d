I have moved my .emacs.d setup from qhart, since they serve such different
purposes.  This is a mashup of a number of different implmentations.

This is setup by clone, but remember to use `--recurse-submodules` to get the
submodules.  Otherwise, you'll have to `git submodule init; git submodule
update`.  Currently, I use sensible-defaults from hrs as a submodule.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/qjhart/.emacs.d.git
#+END_SRC
