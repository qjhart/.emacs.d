I have moved my .emacs.d setup from qhart, since they serve such different
purposes.  This is a mashup of a number of different implmentations.

* Adding to a new server

This is setup by clone, but remember to use `--recurse-submodules` to get the
submodules.  Otherwise, you'll have to `git submodule init; git submodule update`.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/qjhart/.emacs.d.git
cd ~/.emacs.d
cask/bin/cask
#+END_SRC

Everytime, I do this however, I am [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/28441/org-mode-9-unable-to-eval-code-blocks][unable to evaluate code blocks]].  Following
the notes from this link I do this:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd ~/.emacs.d
rm .cask/25.2/elpa/org-9.1.13/*.elc
#+END_SRC

This attempt to recompile those files doesn't seem to work.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (byte-recompile-directory "~/.emacs.d/.cask/25.2/elpa/org-9.1.13")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Done (Total of 0 files compiled, 122 skipped)

* Other Submodules

** yasnippet

[[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][yasnippet]] is a great macro setup.  I use both macro packages supplied by
yassnippet, when you recursively clone the the yasnippet repo.  Additional
macros are added to ~/.emacs.d/snippets

Add to the setup with:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git submodule add --recursive https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet
#+END_SRC
