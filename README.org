I have moved my .emacs.d setup from qhart, since they serve such different
purposes.  This is a mashup of a number of different implemtations.

This is setup with

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

#+END_SRC

** yasnippet

[[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][yasnippet]] is a great macro setup.  I use both macro packages supplied by
yassnippet, when you recursively clone the the yasnippet repo.  Additional
macros are added to ~/.emacs.d/snippets

Add to the setup with:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git submodule add --recursive https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet
#+END_SRC
