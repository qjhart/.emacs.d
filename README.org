#+TITLE: Emacs configuration

This is my emacs configuration file, it's the strategy from the
https://github.com/hrs/dotfiles. Which is pretty terrific. I also got
inspiration from https://github.com/gjstein/emacs.d.  That's where I
decided to only add in the .emacs.d components in their seperate
repository.

Some other examples I've looked at, that are mostly for science-based
installations, include [[https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs][Awesome Emacs]], and [[https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax][SciMax]]

You should be able to clone this repo onto a new machine, and when you
start it up, your default emacs installation jsut comes up naturally
for you.  This is due, in part, to the use-package setup that allows
more auto-matic generation of your personal emacs setup.

This is setup by cloning, but remember to use `--recurse-submodules`
to get any submodules.  Otherwise, you'll have to `git submodule init;
git submodule update`.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/qjhart/.emacs.d.git
#+END_SRC


* Configure =use-package=

I use =use-package= to install and configure my packages. My =init.el= includes
the initial setup for =package.el= and ensures that =use-package= is installed,
since I wanna do that right away.

This makes sure that =use-package= will install the package if it's not already
available. It also means that I should be able to open Emacs for the first time
on a fresh Debian box and have my whole environment automatically installed. I'm
not /totally/ sure about that, but we're gettin' close.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'use-package-ensure)
  (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
#+end_src

Always compile packages, and use the newest version available.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package auto-compile
    :config (auto-compile-on-load-mode))

  (setq load-prefer-newer t)
#+end_src

** Custom Auto-generated customizations

I don't want any customizations stored in my ~init.el~ file, that just
confuses things.  Instead store it seperately.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 (setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/custom.el")
 (load custom-file :noerror)
#+END_SRC


* Editor Keystrokes
** Default Tab Width
I like shallow indentation, but tabs are displayed as 8 characters by default.
This reduces that.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default tab-width 2)
#+END_SRC


#+begin_src emacs-lisp
	(use-package org
		:mode (( "\\.org$" . org-mode ))
		:ensure org
)
#+end_src

I'd like the initial scratch buffer to be in Org:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq initial-major-mode 'org-mode)
#+end_src
